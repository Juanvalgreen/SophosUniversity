This project is an information management system for Sophos University.

The approach to the problem of customer service for the students of the university was the creation of this system. From which a customer advisor can quickly and effectively answer the most common questions and processes of students during the semester. 

Solutions such as: Generate or cancel the enrolment of a course, know how many credits the student has, know which courses he/she is enrolled in, know which professor is teaching the course he/she is looking for, update his/her personal information, etc.
